Description
-----------
Source code of LAMMPS version 22-Jul-2025 is available from [https://github.com/lammps/lammps/releases/tag/stable_22Jul2025](https://github.com/lammps/lammps/releases/tag/stable_22Jul2025). Benchmark results must be produced with this version.

Directory `input` has LAMMPS inputs. Sample Slurm scripts have been provided for reference. 

We supply a LAMMPS parameter file `data.begin.bz2`. This compressed file must be uncompressed before any test runs. It contains coordinates and velocities of ~0.75 million atoms in a cubic unit cell, ~20 nm on a side, representing a 35% LiCl solution pre-equlibrated to 300K and 1 atm. Larger unit cells for "medium" and "large" systems are generated programmatically from this file.

Three LAMMPS benchmarks are required, and input files `small.in`, `medium.in`, `large.in`, and `xlarge.in` are provided. For `medium.in`, `large.in`, and `xlarge.in`, the unit cell decribed above is replicated to create larger cubic cells (via LAMMPS `replicate` commands).  

Directory `NREL_results` has reference results for validation. 

How to Build
------------
The benchmark results for "As-is" tests must be generated from LAMMPS version 22-Jul-2025. Optional libraries or packages included in the LAMMPS distribution (*e.g.*, OpenMP or Intel) may be used and reported as the "optimized code" in the reporting spreadsheet.

LAMMPS can be built by following the instructions at [https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Install.html](https://docs.lammps.org/Build.html). For systems with GPUs, a version should be built with the LAMMPS GPU or KOKKOS package. If the Offeror's chip doesn't support these packages, please contact NREL as soon as possible for possiblilty of using other package such as Kokkos.  

How to Run  
----------
The "As-is" benchmark must be run on Standard and Accelerated nodes with no OpenMP parallization, that is, OMP_NUM_THREADS should be set to 1. Two sample Slurm scripts can be found in `std.4` and `gpu.44` directories for a 4-standard-node run and a 4-GPU-node run with 4 GPUs per node, respectively.
  
Each benchmark case should be run on 1, 2, 4, 8... nodes. For `large` and `xlarge` jobs, especially running on a small number of Accelerated nodes, it is possible that jobs won't run due to the limitation of memory. In this case, `Out of Memory` should be reported in the Spreadsheet response. It is possible that the optimal speed is achieved when number of MPI ranks per node is smaller than the number of CPU cores per node and in this case, the Offeror needs to vary the number of MPI ranks per node to find the optimal value. The "# cores" reported should reflect the number of `physical` CPU cores hosting independent threads of execution.

For each benchmark system size, the total simulation time is controlled via the input parameter `thermo` in the LAMMPS input scripts. As MPI rank counts are increased, `thermo` should be increased in order to maintain a simulation wall time ("Loop time") of 300 seconds or greater, and to keep the total number of simulation steps ("total-running-steps") equal to 10 times `thermo`. 

How to Validate
-------------------------
Numerical results vary somewhat with respect to the number of MPI ranks employed. In recognition of this, we are requesting validation only on four specific runs: using the `medium_numerical_test.in` input in directory `input`, with 64 MPI ranks and on both Standard and Accelerated nodes. For the validation runs, OMP_NUM_THREADS must be set to 1. The performance results from these validation runs are not to be entered into the reporting sheet. A sample Slurm script is provided in `numerical_std` directory. 

A script named `validate.sh` is provided to validate system temperature and total energy data from the output of each of these runs against those obtained by NREL. The Offeror should run this script with the first argument as the path to the output file of a validation run, and the second argument the path to the provided directory `NREL_results` containing reference data. The usage is:

`./validate.sh PATH_TO_OUTPUT/lammps_output PATH_TO_NREL_RESULTS/`

(Example: `./validate.sh numerical_std/medium_numerical_test.log NREL_results/` ) 

This will produce a file called `thermo.dat` that contains time, temperature, and energy output for the run; and, a file `rms_errors.dat` that contains validation information. The first line in `rms_errors.dat` gives the average temperature and energy for the run. These should have values of approximately 300 and -8.9e+07, respectively. The second line gives the relative root-mean-squared deviation between the output provided by NREL (in `NREL_thermo.dat`) and the output from the test run. Reasonable relative deviations are less than 10<sup>-3</sup> for temperature and 10<sup>-5</sup> for energy. The validation script returns either "run validated" or "run not validated" on the third line of `rms_errors.dat`, depending on whether deviations are less than or greater than these thresholds, respectively.

Reporting Results
-----------------
For the Spreadsheet response, the target performance numbers are "timesteps/s" as reported in the LAMMPS standard output stream. In addition to these values, the total number-of-steps that have been run and the reported "Loop time" must be included as well. Example logfile output looks like

`Loop time of 317.023 on 128 procs for 8000 steps with 5952000 atoms`  
`Performance: 2.180 ns/day, 11.008 hours/ns, 25.235 timesteps/s, 150.198 Matom-step/s`

In this case, the number-of-steps is 8000, the loop-time is 317.023 seconds, and the performance is 25.235 timesteps/s.

## What Must be Returned
In addition to the performance results, (a) output log files from the four validation runs, and (b) `rms_errors.dat` files from validation should also be included in the File response.
